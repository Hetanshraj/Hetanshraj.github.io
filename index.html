            As of currently I am doing Computer Programming and Analysis which will open the gates for many 
            categories in the IT world, and the category I want to pursue is the Video Game industry. In 2020
            Video Games Industry made more annual revenue then the film industry shows the promising progress 
            of Video Game Industry. I would like to work as a Game designer and share my perspective and experience
            to make the game appealing and user-friendly. This is my goal, and I will put in all my efforts 
            to accomplish it.

            Expertise        
        </h2>    
        <p>
            Coming to Canada has really been beneficial for my personal growth. It has allowed me to become very 
            responsible, hardworking, and dedicated about my future. After doing many volunteering hours at 
            Salvation Army in my city Scarborough. That helped me how to communicate with a customer and 
            improve critical thinking skills as I had to deal with new ideas and schemes to attract customers. Then I 
            started an online certificate to improve my leadership skills which has proven very beneficial to me. 
            Later, I worked at Burger King as a cashier that taught me how to deal with everyone politely and 
            respectfully under heavy pressure. In my off time I started learning computer skills that made me very 
            fluent with softwareâ€™s like, Adobe, Word, Excel, Google Docs, sheets, slides, Linux, Unix, making me <b id="Honesty"></b> <!-- Cuz of fixed header -->
            flexible and familiar with all the latest programs and softwares in the computer.
